# Fanalysis

### Inspiration
Fanfiction is a medium that is often derided for its allowance of wish fulfillment and amateurish writing. This mindset, however, ignores the uncomfortable truth that what occurs in fanfiction reflects the will of the fans. This is to say that in the media that consumers create, one can see what they desire. That is the inspiration behind Fanalysisâ€”allowing creators to analyze fanfiction statistics to best determine what direction they should bring their IP to best please their fans.

### What it does
Fanalysis offers an overview on some of the most popular franchises in the fanfiction space. Users can view things like fan engagement through works released over time, as well as viewing what events spurred greater fan engagement. Through this data, the user can make more informed decisions about their IP.

### How we built it
We used Hostinger and libraries like Chart.js to create the frontend, and we used a combination of PANDAS (Python) and JavaScript to implement our backend. We hosted it on a domain purchased through get.tech.

### Challenges we ran into
We ran into several issues while developing the project. When looking for statistics, we were able to find stats on fanfiction from 2013-2024, with the exception of 2018. This omission caused there to be a hole in our data. We were able to write a script to best approximate the data for 2018, which allowed our data to be used in complex ways.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of the fanfiction dataset that we custom built for our application to have data to operate on. There is no other database of a comparable size when it comes to fanfiction, and it opens new doors when it comes to fandom analysis. We are also proud of our hosting solution. We don't have much experience when it comes cross-platform hosting, but we still got it up and running.

### What we learned
We learned how to leverage powerful libraries like PANDAS to analyze data for our applications. We also learned how to work in tandem with powerful services like Hostinger.

### What's next for Fananalysis
Fanalysis is heavily dependant on many different fandoms from which it collects data from. The next step for Fanalysis is to feature greater integration with the fandoms themselves. For example, a fandom surrounding a band will have greater statistics regarding their discography, while a TV show fandom will have greater data for each episode and how it relates to the greater fandom.
